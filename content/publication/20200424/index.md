abstract: '*Objectives*: Frenulectomy for ankyloglossia is an intervention that often improves breastfeeding quality for both the mother and infant. Current classification systems assess and identify patients with ankyloglossia, but they do not predict the degree of improvement after lingual frenulectomy. We propose an idealized geometric model to quantify the potential effect of frenulectomy for ankyloglossia.<br>*Methods*: Our geometric model depicts the intact lingual frenulum as a triangular pyramid of mucosa on the floor of mouth. After incising one edge of the pyramid, as is performed during a frenulectomy, the structure unfolds to a two-dimensional diamond whose dimensions can be calculated. Utilizing this calculation, we can predict percent improvement in tongue extension after frenulectomy based off the original dimensions of the pyramid.<br>*Results*: Our multivariable equation that allows for the calculation of the percent increase in tongue extension is based on the frenulum thickness, frenulum length, tongue length, and insertion point of the frenulum on the tongue. The initial height of the frenulum and the proximity of the frenulum insertion to the tip of the tongue had the largest impact on tongue extension, whereas frenulum width had the smallest impact.<br>*Conclusion*: Lingual frenulectomy has subjectively been reported to improve lingual tongue movement. Our mathematical model identifies multiple anatomic variables that lead to an increase in tongue extension after frenulectomy. Our model is the first step in supporting this subjective improvement with quantifiable measurements, and can allow for future validation studies.'

summary: Frenulectomy for ankyloglossia is an intervention that often improves breastfeeding quality for both the mother and infant. Current classification systems assess and identify patients with ankyloglossia, but they do not predict the degree of improvement after lingual frenulectomy. We propose an idealized geometric model to quantify the potential effect of frenulectomy for ankyloglossia.
