I'm Emma Peterman, an NSF Graduate Research Fellow in [the Galloway Lab](https://gallowaylab.mit.edu/) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. My current research is focused on designing genetic circuits to enable quorum sensing and regeneration within mammalian cell populations in response to external stimuli. Prior to MIT, I completed my B.S. in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of Delaware, where I researched pulmonary delivery of polymer nanoparticles with [the Fromen Research Group](https://sites.udel.edu/cfromen/).

In addition to my research, I am passionate about outreach in my community, specifically focused on empowering young female scientists.
