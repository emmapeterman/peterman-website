The first time that I envisioned my future as a scientist, I was standing in my elementary school cafeteria adorned in my homemade replica of Sally Ride’s space suit for our annual wax museum. From an early age, I was fascinated by everything from geology to physics, but there was a common theme in all of my lessons on influential scientists; whether it was Albert Einstein, Ben Franklin, or Isaac Newton, there was a stark lack of women in my textbooks. After learning about Sally Ride, I was finally able to envision myself among these great scientists, igniting a desire in me to make my own impact on the world. It wasn’t until my junior year of high school that I discovered my passion for chemistry. Combining my interests in both chemistry and design, I decided to pursue a degree in chemical engineering at the University of Delaware.<br><br>

As soon as I stepped foot on campus, I was itching to get involved with research and start applying the skills I began developing in high school to real-world challenges. As a freshman in [the Fromen Research Group](https://sites.udel.edu/cfromen/), I began training as a member of the 3D printing team, prototyping *in vitro* lung models, and later progressed to designing my own independent projects during my sophomore and junior years. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic derailing my planned research, I managed to contribute to two peer-reviewed publications, one being a first-author manuscript. My development as a scientist during this time would not have been possible without the valuable mentorship of Dr. Fromen and graduate student, Emily Kolewe. The opportunity to learn directly from up and coming female scientists has been invaluable for building my confidence as a researcher. My time in the Fromen Lab solidified my desire to become a professor and follow the path of women who have inspired me, allowing me to pursue my research interests and my passion for disseminating knowledge to scientists and non-scientists alike.<br><br>
